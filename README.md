# Prodigy Infotech Internship Portfolio

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of all tasks and projects I successfully completed during my cybersecurity internship with **Prodigy Infotech**.

The internship focused on applying **Python programming** to practical **information security** challenges. Each project involved building a functional tool from the ground up, strengthening my understanding of key concepts in cryptography, data analysis, and automation.

## üöÄ Projects
